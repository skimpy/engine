# Skimpy Engine

The engine for SkimpyCMS.

Skimpy allows you to create a flat file based website or blog. It is not a static site generator.

If you are trying to build a skimpy site, please use the [Skimpy CMS Repo](https://github.com/skimpy/cms)

If you are trying to work on and install just the engine

1. `composer install`
2. `./vendor/bin/phpspec run --format=pretty --stop-on-failure`
